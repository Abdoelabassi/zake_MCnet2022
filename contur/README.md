# Constraining new physics models using Contur

## THURSDAY (4pm)

Contact: Jon Butterworth, Yoran Yeh, Tony Yue

**NB: It would be advisable to follow the prerequisites (below) ahead of the tutorial to avoid bandwidth issues.**

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, we will be using the latest Contur Docker image. To download the image, simply type:

```
  docker pull hepstore/contur-herwig:latest
```

In addition, we've prepared some steering files for illustration and a signal grid that will be analysed in the tutorial. 
They are provided [here](https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/SJmYPBwY9HxVYQp). Please download them ahead of the tutorial as well.
At the same time, please run the docker image with the downloaded file in your run directory so that the file will appear in the contur-tutorial directory.
